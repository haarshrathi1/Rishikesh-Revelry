                    The scorching sun blazes over Ahmedabad, painting the city in vibrant hues as five friends—Aarush, Vihaan, Rudra, Kiaan, and Yuvan—gear up for their epic trek to Kuari Pass. All 20 and 21 years old, they're buzzing with excitement and a hint of rebellion. Aarush, the fearless leader with a knack for stirring things up, is tossing gear into his backpack like there's no tomorrow. Vihaan, the group's comedian, cracks jokes that have everyone in stitches. Rudra, the meticulous planner, is double-checking their gadgets and maps, ensuring nothing is left behind. Kiaan, the smooth-talking charmer, is making sure everyone's spirits are high with his infectious energy. Yuvan, the introspective artist, sketches their adventure plans in his well-worn notebook. The apartment is a whirlwind of laughter, playful bickering, and last-minute chaos as they prepare for the adventure of a lifetime.

                    Boarding the overnight train from Ahmedabad Railway Station to Yog Nagari Rishikesh Railway Station, the crew hustles through the crowded compartments, determined to stick together. The compartment is a mix of snoozers and chatters, filled with the aroma of chai and the hum of conversations. Vihaan accidentally ends up next to an eccentric old man decked out in colorful beads and a patched-up shawl. Without missing a beat, Vihaan starts mimicking the old man's accent, sending everyone into fits of laughter.

                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    The old man, amused but mysterious, spins a spooky yarn about trekkers who vanished near Kuari Pass, claiming restless spirits roam the trails. “They say the mountains hold secrets no one should uncover,” he warns, his eyes glinting under the dim train lights.

                    The friends laugh it off, but Yuvan catches a flicker of unease in his eyes, sparking a silent curiosity. “Maybe we should pack an extra flashlight,” Yuvan muses quietly, glancing at Rudra who merely smirks.

After a playful debate filled with friendly jabs and exaggerated gestures, they decide to give it a shot. They move into a quirky hostel where rooms are named after Himalayan peaks, each decorated with vibrant tapestries and funky lights. The common area boasts a massive mural of Shiva dancing amidst a cosmic backdrop, setting the tone for unforgettable nights ahead.

The friends gather on the rooftop terrace, the cool morning breeze a stark contrast to the night's warmth. They share their dreams and fears, the remnants of bhang and alcohol still tingling in their veins. Yuvan opens up about a recurring dream of hidden mountain paths and ancient secrets, igniting a spark of intrigue among the group.
