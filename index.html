They are all around 20 years old and very excited. Aarush, the leader, is packing his backpack quickly. Vihaan, the funny one, is making everyone laugh with jokes. Rudra, the planner, is checking their maps and gadgets carefully. Kiaan, the charming friend, is keeping everyone's spirits high. Yuvan, the quiet artist, is drawing their adventure plans.

                    They board an overnight train from Ahmedabad to Rishikesh. The train is crowded with people sleeping and talking. Vihaan accidentally sits next to an old man with colorful beads and a shawl. Vihaan starts imitating the old man's accent, making everyone laugh.

The common area has a big mural of Shiva dancing in space, setting the mood for fun nights ahead.
